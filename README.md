# KeyTracker

This repository is for the model simulator for KeyTracker. We develop this simulator, which can fully model the design of KeyTracker, to analyze real packet traces based on Libpcap.

More evaluation detailes (packet traces and parameters of KeyTracker) are provided at [KeySight evaluation](https://github.com/KeySight-P4/keysight-evaluation)
